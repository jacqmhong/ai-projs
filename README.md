# Projects on the Core Ideas of Artificial Intelligence 

These projects use the classic Pacman game to practice foundational AI concepts, such as search algorithms, multiagent minimax and expectimax, reinforcement learning, hidden markov models, classification, etc. Only files that are edited are included. These files contain minimal starter code by cs188 staff. Personal code lines are marked.

Projects in chronological order:
1) Search: depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search
2) Multi-agent search: multiagent minimax and expectimax
3) Reinforcement learning: model-based and model-free reinforcement learning
4) Ghost busters: Bayes nets and hidden markov models
5) Machine learning: perceptron algorithm and neural network models, digit classification
